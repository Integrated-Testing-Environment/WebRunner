Socket Driver
----

* This is an experimental feature.
* The Socket Server is mainly used to allow other programming languages to use AutoControl.
* It processes received strings and performs actions through the underlying executor.
* Tests can be performed remotely through this feature.
* Currently, Java and C# support are experimental.
* Return_Data_Over_JE should be transmitted at the end of each paragraph.
* UTF-8 encoding is used.
* Sending quit_server will shut down the server.
